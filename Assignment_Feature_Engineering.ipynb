        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "  - A parameter is a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value can be estimated from data. Examples include weights in linear regression or neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "  - Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "  - A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "  - Machine Learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The main components are:\n",

        "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "  - The loss value indicates how well the model's predictions match the actual outcomes. A lower loss means better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "  - Continuous variables are numeric and can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",

        "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "Common techniques include:\n",

        "\n",
        "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "  - Training a dataset means using data to fit a model. Testing means evaluating model performance on unseen data to check its generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "  - `sklearn.preprocessing` is a module in Scikit-learn that provides functions for data preprocessing such as scaling, normalization, and encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a Test set?\n",
        "  - A test set is a portion of the dataset used to evaluate the final model performance after training.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "  - Using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`:\n",
        "      ```python\n",
        "      from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
        "      X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
